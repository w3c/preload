    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Many applications require fine-grained control over when resources are
    fetched, processed, and applied to the document. For example, the loading
    and processing of some resources may be deferred by the application to
    reduce resource contention and improve performance of the initial load.
    This behavior is typically achieved by moving resource fetching into custom
    resource loading logic defined by the application - i.e. resource fetches
    are initiated via injected elements, or via `XMLHttpRequest`, when
    particular application conditions are met.</p>
    <p>However, there are also cases where some resources need to be fetched as
    early as possible, but their processing and execution logic is subject to
    application-specific requirements - e.g. dependency management, conditional
    loading, ordering guarantees, and so on. Currently, it is not possible to
    deliver this behavior without a performance penalty.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Declaring a resource via one of the existing elements (e.g. `img`,
      `script`, `link`) couples resource fetching and execution. Whereas, an
      application may want to fetch, but delay execution of the resource until
      some condition is met.</li>
      <li>Fetching resources with `XMLHttpRequest` to avoid above behavior
      incurs a serious performance penalty by hiding resource declarations from
      the user agent's DOM and preload parsers. The resource fetches are only
      dispatched when the relevant JavaScript is executed, which due to
      abundance of blocking scripts on most pages introduces significant delays
      and affects application performance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <a>preload</a> keyword on [link] elements provides a declarative
    fetch primitive that addresses the above use case of initiating an early
    fetch and separating fetching from resource execution. As such,
    <a>preload</a> keyword serves as a low-level primitive that enables
    applications to build custom resource loading and execution behaviors
    without hiding resources from the user agent and incurring delayed resource
    fetching penalties.</p>
    <p>For example, the application can use the preload keyword to initiate
    early, high-priority, and non-render-blocking fetch of a CSS resource that
    can then be applied by the application at appropriate time:</p>
    <pre class="example html" title="Using markup">
&lt;!-- preload stylesheet resource via declarative markup --&gt;
&lt;link rel="preload" href="/styles/other.css" as="style"&gt;

&lt;!-- or, preload stylesheet resource via JavaScript --&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
var res = document.createElement("link");
res.rel = "preload";
res.as = "style";
res.href = "styles/other.css";
document.head.appendChild(res);
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
    <pre class="example nolinks http" title="Using HTTP Header">
  Link: &lt;https://example.com/other/styles.css&gt;; rel=preload; as=style
</pre>
    <p>As above examples illustrate, the resource can be specified via
    declarative markup, Link HTTP header ([[!RFC5988]]), or scheduled via
    JavaScript. See <a href='#use-cases'>use cases</a> section for more
    hands-on examples of how and where <a>preload</a> can be used.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Link type "<code>preload</code>"</h2>
    <p>The <dfn data-lt="preload keyword">preload</dfn> keyword may be used
    with [link] elements. This keyword creates an [external resource link]
    (<dfn>preload link</dfn>) that is used to declare a resource and its fetch
    properties. [[!HTML5]]</p>
    <p class="note" title="feature detection">If the preload keyword is used as
    an optimization to initiate earlier fetch then no additional feature
    detection checks are necessary: browsers that support preload will initiate
    earlier fetch, and those that do not will ignore it and fetch the resource
    as previously. Otherwise, if the application intends to rely on preload to
    fetch the resource, then it can [execute a feature detection
    check][feature-detect] to verify that it is supported.</p>
    <p class="note" title="relationship to prefetch">Both `prefetch`
    ([[RESOURCE-HINTS]]) and `preload` declare a resource and its fetch
    properties, but differ in how and when the resource is fetched by the user
    agent: `prefetch` is an optional and low-priority fetch for a resource that
    might be used by a subsequent navigation; `preload` is a mandatory and
    high-priority fetch for a resource that is necessary for the current
    navigation. Developers should use each one accordingly to minimize resource
    contention and optimize load performance.</p>
    <section>
      <h2>Processing</h2>
      <p>The <dfn>appropriate times</dfn> to <a>obtain the preload resource</a>
      are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When the user agent that supports [[!RFC5988]] processes `Link`
        header that contains a <a>preload link</a>.
        </li>
        <li>When the <a>preload link</a>'s [link] element is [inserted into a
        document].
        </li>
        <li>When the <a>preload link</a> is created on a [link] element that is
        already [in a Document].
        </li>
        <li>When the `href` attribute of the [link] element of a <a>preload
        link</a> that is already [in a Document] is changed.
        </li>
        <li>When the `crossorigin` attribute of the [link] element of a
        <a>preload link</a> that is already [in a Document] is set, changed, or
        removed.
        </li>
        <li>When the `as` attribute of the [link] element of a <a>preload
        link</a> that is already [in a Document] is set or changed to a value
        that does not or no longer matches the <a>request destination</a> of
        the previous obtained external resource, if any.
        </li>
        <li>When the `as` attribute of the [link] element of a <a>preload
        link</a> that is already [in a Document] but was previously not
        obtained due to the `as` attribute specifying an unsupported <a>request
        destination</a> is set, removed, or changed.
        </li>
        <li>When the `type` attribute of the [link] element of a <a>preload
        link</a> that is already [in a Document] but was previously not
        obtained due to the `type` attribute not specifying a
        [parsable MIME type] or specifying an [unsupported MIME type] for the
        <a>request destination</a> is set, removed, or changed.
        </li>
        <li>When the `media` attribute of the [link] element of a <a>preload
        link</a> that is already [in a Document] but was not previousely
        obtained due the `media` attribute's value being not a
        [valid media query list] or one that does not [match the environment] is set,
        removed, or changed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The user agent SHOULD abort the current request if the `href`
      attribute of the [link] element of a <a>preload link</a> is changed,
      removed, or its value is set to an empty string.</p>
      <p>To <dfn>obtain the preload resource</dfn>, the user agent must run the
      following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>If the `href` attribute's value is missing or is the empty string,
        then abort these steps.</li>
        <li>[Resolve] the [URL] (<i>absolute url</i>) given by the `href`
        attribute, relative to the element.</li>
        <li>If the previous step fails, then abort these steps.</li>
        <li>Validate the <i><dfn>request destination</dfn></i> given by the
        `as` attribute. If the attribute is omitted, then initialize it to the
        empty string. If the provided value is not a [valid request
        destination], then [queue a task] to [fire an event] named
        `error` at the [link] element and abort these steps.[[!FETCH]]</li>
        <li>If the `type` attribute's value is missing or is the empty string,
        then continue to the next step.
        Otherwise, If the `type` attribute's value is not a [parsable MIME type]
        or is an [unsupported MIME type], then abort these steps. </li>
        <li>If the `media` attribute's value is missing or is the empty string,
        then continue to the next step.
        Otherwise, if the `media` attribute's value is not a [valid media query
        list] that does [match the environment], then abort these steps.</li>
        <li>Do a potentially CORS-enabled fetch of the resulting <i>absolute
        URL</i>, with the <i>mode</i> being the current state of the element's
        [crossorigin] content attribute, the <i>origin</i> being the [origin]
        of the [link] element's [node document], <i>destination</i> set to
        <i>request destination</i>, and the <i>default origin behavior</i> set
        to <i>taint</i>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The <a>preload link</a> element MUST NOT [delay the load event] of the
      element's [node document].</p>
      <p class="note">The fetch initiated by a <a>preload link</a> is subject
      to relevant CSP policies determined by the value of the `as` attribute -
      e.g. when set to `image` the fetch is subject to `image-src`. Similarly,
      the value of the `as` attribute is used to initialize request headers and
      priority. If the `as` attribute is omitted, the request will be
      initialized with similar processing and request properties as one
      initiated by `XMLHttpRequest`.</p>
      <p>Once a <dfn>preload resource has been <a data-lt=
      "obtain the preload resource">obtained</a></dfn>, the user agent must run
      these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>If the load was successful, [queue a task] to [fire an event]
        named `load` at the [link] element. Otherwise, [queue a task] to [fire
        a simple event] named `error` at the [link] element.</li>
        <li>Add request to fetch group's response cache.
          <div class="note">
            <p>In addition to the HTTP cache, all browser implementations
            provide one or more levels of additional caches, which sometimes
            live before the HTTP cache (e.g. HTTP/2 server push responses are
            typically not commited to HTTP cache until a client request is
            made), and after the HTTP cache (e.g. in-process memory caches).
            These caches are not defined today and need to be defined in Fetch
            API— see [related
            discussion](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/354).</p>
            <p>Conceptually, a preloaded response ought to be committed to the
            HTTP cache, as it is initiated by the client, and also be available
            in the memory cache and be re-usable at least once within the
            lifetime of a fetch group.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The user agent MUST NOT automatically execute or apply the resource
      against the current page context.</p>
      <p class="note">For example, if a JavaScript resource is fetched via a
      <a>preload link</a> and the response contains a `no-cache` directive, the
      fetched response is retained by the user agent and is made immediately
      available when fetched with a matching same navigation request at a later
      time - e.g. via a `script` tag or other means. This ensures that the user
      agent does not incur an unnecessary revalidation, or a duplicate
      download, between the initial resource fetch initiated via the preload
      link and a later fetch requesting the same resource.</p>

      <h2>Link element interface extensions</h2>
      <pre class="idl">
partial interface HTMLLinkElement {
  [CEReactions] attribute DOMString as;
};
</pre>
      <p>The <dfn for="HTMLLinkElement">as</dfn> attribute's value MUST be a
      valid [request destination]. If the provided value is omitted, the value
      is initialized to the empty string.</p>
      <p>The user agent MUST set the [request destination] provided by `as`, as
      well as the corresponding [request type] and [request initiator]. This is
      necessary to guarantee correct prioritization, request matching,
      application of the correct [[!CSP3]] policy, and setting of the
      appropriate `Accept` request header.</p>
      <p>When the resource is declared via the `Link` header field
      ([[!RFC5988]]), the resource's `as` attribute is defined via the `as`
      link-extension target attribute. ([[!RFC5988]] section 5.4)</p>

      <h2>Server Push (HTTP/2)</h2>
      <p>HTTP/2 ([[!RFC7540]]) allows a server to pre-emptively send ("push")
      responses to the client. A pushed response is semantically equivalent to
      a server responding to a request and, similar to a preloaded response, is
      retained by the user agent and executed by the application when matched
      with a request initiated by the application. As such, from an application
      perspective, there is no difference between consuming a preload or a
      server push response.</p>
      <p>The server MAY initiate server push for <a>preload link</a> resources
      defined by the application for which it is [authoritative][]. Initiating
      server push eliminates the request roundtrip between client and server
      for the declared <a>preload link</a> resource. Optionally, if the use of
      server push is not desired for a resource declared via the `Link` header
      field ([[!RFC5988]]), the developer MAY provide an opt-out signal to the
      server via the `nopush` target attribute ([[!RFC5988]] section 5.4). For
      example:</p>
      <pre class="example nolinks http">
  Link: &lt;/app/style.css&gt;; rel=preload; as=style; nopush
  Link: &lt;/app/script.js&gt;; rel=preload; as=script
</pre>
      <p class="note">The above example indicates to an HTTP/2 push capable
      server that `/app/style.css` should not be pushed (e.g. the origin may
      have additional information indicating that it may already be in cache),
      while `/app/script.js` should be considered as a candidate for server
      push.</p>
      <p>Initiating server push for a <a>preload link</a> is an optional
      optimization. For example, the server might omit initiating push if it
      believes that the response is available in the client's cache: the client
      will process the preload directive, check the relevant caches, and
      initiate the request to the server if the resource is missing.
      Alternatively, the server might omit initiating push due to operational
      concerns, such as available server resources or other criteria. Finally,
      the use of server push is subject to negotiated HTTP/2 connection
      settings: the client may limit or outright disable the use of server
      push. Applications cannot rely on the availability and use of server
      push.</p>

  <section id="conformance">
    <p>There is only one class of product that can claim conformance to this
    specification: a <dfn>user agent</dfn>.</p>
  </section>
  <section class='appendix informative'>
    <h2>Use cases</h2>
    <section>
      <h2>Early fetch of critical resources</h2>
      <p>Preload parsers are used by most user agents to initiate early
      resource fetches while the main document parser is blocked due to a
      blocking script. However, the preload parsers do not execute JavaScript,
      and typically only perform a shallow parse of CSS, which means that the
      fetch of resources specified within JavaScript and CSS is delayed until
      the relevant document parser is able to process the resource
      declaration.</p>
      <p>In effect, most resources declarations specified within JavaScript and
      CSS are "hidden" from the speculative parsers and incur a performance
      penalty. To address this, the application can use a <a>preload link</a>
      to declaratively specify which resources the user agent must fetch early
      to improve page performance:</p>
      <pre class="example nolinks html" title=
      "Early fetch of critical resources">
&lt;link rel="preload" href="/assets/font.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2"&gt;
&lt;link rel="preload" href="/style/other.css" as="style"&gt;
&lt;link rel="preload" href="//example.com/resource"&gt;
&lt;link rel="preload" href="https://fonts.example.com/font.woff2" as="font" crossorigin type="font/woff2"&gt;
</pre>
      <p>Above markup initiates four resource fetches: a font resource, a
      stylesheet, an unknown resource type from another origin, and a font
      resource from another origin. Each fetch is initialized with appropriate
      request headers and priority - the unknown type is equivalent to a fetch
      initiated `XMLHttpRequest` request. Further, these requests do not block
      the parser or the load event.</p>
      <p class="note">Preload links for CORS enabled resources, such as fonts
      or images with a `crossorigin` attribute, must also include a
      `crossorigin` attribute, in order for the resource to be properly
      used.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Early fetch and application defined execution</h2>
      <p>The <a>preload link</a> can be used by the application to initiate
      early fetch of one or more resources, as well as to provide custom logic
      for when and how each response should be applied to the document. The
      application may:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Decide to immediately apply each resource as it becomes
        available.</li>
        <li>Ensure that resources are applied in some application specific
        order.</li>
        <li>Apply resources conditionally based on arbitrary resource or
        application criteria.</li>
        <li>Defer resource application until some application condition is
        met.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The <a>preload link</a> provides a low-level and content-type agnostic
      primitive that enables applications to build custom resource loading and
      execution behaviors without incurring the penalty of delayed resource
      loading.</p>
      <p>For example, <a>preload link</a> enables the application to provide
      `async` and `defer` like semantics, which are only available on `script`
      elements today, but for any content-type: applying the resource
      immediately after it is available provides `async` functionality, whereas
      adding some ordering logic enables `defer` functionality. Further, this
      behavior can be defined across a mix of content-types - the application
      is in full control over when and how each resource is applied.</p>
      <pre class="example html">
&lt;script&gt;
  function preloadFinished(e) { ... }
  function preloadError(e)  { ... }
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!-- listen for load and error events --&gt;
&lt;link rel="preload" href="app.js" as="script" onload="preloadFinished()" onerror="preloadError()"&gt;
</pre>
      <p>By decoupling resource fetching from execution, the <a>preload
      link</a> provides a future-proof primitive for building performant
      application specific resource loading strategies.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Developer, server, and proxy-initiated fetching</h2>
      <p>The <a>preload link</a> can be specified by the developer, or be
      automatically generated by the application server or an optimization
      proxy (e.g. a CDN).</p>
      <pre class="example nolinks http">
  Link: &lt;https://example.com/font.woff2&gt;; rel=preload; as=font; type='font/woff2'
  Link: &lt;https://example.com/app/script.js&gt;; rel=preload; as=script
  Link: &lt;https://example.com/logo-hires.jpg&gt;; rel=preload; as=image
  Link: &lt;https://fonts.example.com/font.woff2&gt;; rel=preload; as=font; crossorigin; type='font/woff2'
</pre>
      <pre class="example html">
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="//example.com/widget.html" as="document"&gt;
</pre>
      <pre class="example html">
  &lt;script&gt;
  var res = document.createElement("link");
  res.rel = "preload";
  res.as = "document";
  res.href = "/other/widget.html";
  document.head.appendChild(res);
  &lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
      <ul>
        <li>The application can specify preload links, allowing:
          <ul>
            <li>The user agent to initiate early fetch of critical
            resources.</li>
            <li>The optimization proxy to fetch the critical resources and
            place them into its cache ahead of time, thus reducing or
            eliminating the latency of retrieving resources from origin.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The optimization proxy can specify preload links on behalf of the
        application:
          <ul>
            <li>The proxy can observe and infer critical resources based on
            past request patterns, allowing it to automate generation of
            relevant preload links to improve page performance.</li>
            <li>The proxy can deliver inferred preload links to the user agent
            while it is blocked on the response from the origin, allowing the
            user agent to begin early fetch of associated critical resources.
              <ul>
                <li>Many existing optimization proxies implement "early flush"
                strategies where references to associated critical resources
                are automatically delivered to the user agent while the proxy
                is blocked on the response from the origin. Today, this is
                typically done by creating a fake document `head` that contains
                `XMLHttpRequest`, `image`, and `object` requests for the
                associated critical resources. However, in practice, these
                implementations are brittle and often result in prioritization
                conflicts with requests initiated by speculative and document
                parsers, or worse, result in delayed or double downloads due to
                missing request context information. The <a>preload link</a>
                addresses these problems by providing a declarative fetch
                primitive, and interoperability with the HTTP Link header, that
                communicates both the URL and the context of the resource.

    <h2>Privacy and Security</h2>
    <p>Preload is a declarative fetch primitive that initiates early fetch of
    resources and separates fetching from resource execution. In effect, it is
    conceptually similar to initiating a scripted fetch for a resource, but
    with additional constraints and benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The resource declaration is visible via HTTP headers or HTML markup,
      which allows the user agent to initiate the fetch earlier, and without
      blocking on JavaScript execution.</li>
      <li>The response is not executed and there is no callback to retrieve its
      payload. The response is retrieved and executed by initiating another
      fetch (via script, DOM element, etc) that matches the preloaded
      response.</li>
      <li>The developer can specify the target context that will consume the
      response via `as` attribute, which allows the user agent to enforce the
      relevant CSP policies when initiating the preload fetch. If `as` is
      omitted, preload defaults to same security and privacy processing as a
      call to `fetch()` - i.e. subject to `connect-src`.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The site authors are encouraged to take the necessary precautions and
    specify the relevant [[!CSP3]], [[!MIXED-CONTENT]], and
    [[!REFERRER-POLICY]] rules, such that the browser can enforce them when
    initiating the preload request. Additionally, if preload directives are
    provided via the `Link` HTTP response header, then the relevant policies
    should also be delivered as an HTTP response header - e.g. see <a href=
    "https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/content-security-policy/#complications">
    Processing Complications</a> for CSP.</p>
